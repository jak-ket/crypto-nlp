rtrimm,"Basically, the value of fiat currencies are going down. But while that's happening, the price of Bitcoin stays the same.

So before inflation, one Bitcoin was $60,000. But after inflation, the price is still $60,000. So Bitcoins value was effected by inflation too!

If Bitcoin was deflating in value, then after fiat inflation, BTC would be worth $70,000, or $75,000 to account for inflation.

Billy Bob owes me money which is around what 1btc is worth. This person lives in a different country and bank transfer will be tricky, and in theory I'd have to report it as a gift, and pay 30% tax on it. 
I'm thinking of using BTC or cryptocurrencies to make the transfer anonymously. But I feel like the purchase of BTC is always registered.

Am I overthinking this? Is this risky?

3. It peacefully demonetizes the state. Puts a wrench in to money printing scam from witch most of the state's funding is produced.

1. I recently posted asking how btc can ever become a genuine currency when the main reason people hold it is because it is an appreciating asset. 

Why would anyone ever spend it? If nobody spends it then what is it?

I had hoped for some good responses but it was mostly underwhelming:

- I‚Äôm wrong, most people spend it and I‚Äôm delusional.

Lol

- it‚Äôs more of a commodity than a currency. 

If it is a commodity though (like gold), does it have a secondary function? Gold can be created into jewellery so it has something to ‚Äúback it‚Äù. Ive always thought the mining acts as a backing, but if they stop? I know people will always say, ‚Äúsomeone else will mine it‚Äù, but that doesn‚Äôt really answer the question. 

2. Tether - I did not truly understand why Tether not being backed by USD mattered for btc, however I recently learned that Tether is owned by Bitfinex (an exchange), meaning they can print their own BTC. 

üö®üö® Alarm bellsüö®üö®

I realise it‚Äôs impossible for us to know if they do really back each Tether with a USD unless they show proof, but what is the argument against this to explain why this is not inflating the btc price? Im hoping the response is better than just denying tether doesn‚Äôt print money.

Speculative mania phases never last very long and once the bubble burst reality sets in quickly.

Over the long term markets are very efficient truth finding machines.

The collective wisdom and intelligence of markets is bigger than the intelligence and wisdom of the average investor in the same market.

If you make  a price prediction and you are wrong after 1 year you can still argue that the market is wrong and you are right but if you make  a price prediction and are still wrong after 5 or 10 years chances are very high that you were wrong and the market was right.

Bitcoin critics like  Peter Schiff have been claiming that Bitcoin is worth 0 for 10 years and the market has been telling them they are wrong for 10 years.

Assuming that Schiff is right that would not only mean the market which is an efficient pricing machine over the long term is  irrational and getting even more irrational over time. Historically this is not how markets have worked.

If we look at other bubbles in history we find the railroad mania, the tulip bubble and the dotcom bubble. All of these had speculative mania, unsophisticated investor participation and overpriced shares and assets which turned out to be worthless. Collapse of the market was seen within 2 years of mania onset. The market was very good at figuring out that the assets were mispriced and corrected itself like it should have.

Bitcoin has seen several bull markets so far that ended in what resembled a speculative mania which corrected itself in less than 2 years. The market corrected itself like it should have.

Bitcoin had listings in major futures exchanges since 2017. It's not a closed or small obscure market.

I don't think in history of finance there have been cases of speculative mania phases that lasted over 10 years and had several 70% corrections and longer bear markets.

Since its launch in late June, the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITI), the pioneering US-based Bitcoin ETF, has been a hit. According to data published by Arcane Research on the evening of July 6, capital inflows are concentrated mainly on short-selling BTC ETF products. BITI has grown over 300% in just a few days.

The timing of the BITI launch itself is also considered quite ideal, as BTC **has plummeted to an 18-month low of $17,600** and is still entrenched around the $20,000 mark.  


The GBTC premium, the difference between the market price of Bitcoin spot and the GBTC stock held by the trust, has been negative for over a year. This metric shows that the inflow of BTC has decreased significantly, resulting in a situation where GBTC is trading below the spot price in the market.

Analysts' expectations are still tilted towards the market trend that will continue to turn bad, BTC will slide again and the above figure of BITI also somewhat confirms the sentiment of the current crowd.

According to CoinShares, weekly inflows into BTC short-selling products contributed $51 million out of a total of $64 million in inflows for the whole week. Meanwhile, investments in BTC (long) products are only at $20 million.  


Up to $423 million of institutional capital flowed out of digital investment products between June 20 and June 24 alone. Although many big players have retreated from the market, investment products that offer the ability to short BTC have signaled a reversal, the reason is attributed to the news that **ProShares launched the first ""short-sell"" Bitcoin ETF. first in the United States.**

ProShares has emerged since the **launch of the first Bitcoin ETF in the US** based on futures contracts, **reaching $1 billion in trading volume** on the first day of launch, followed by many other Bitcoin derivatives ETFs that were approved one by one.

If you want to use it as a medium of exchange for goods and services, or transfer of funds, the price doesn't actually matter: 1 BTC could be $1M or $1, you'd just buy some, send it, and the recipient would redeem it in the currency of their choice (or you buy something with it, but same idea).

I fail to see how the belief that BTC's value as compared to the US dollar will increase over time is anything but circular logic that nearly 100% depends on the majority of BTC market participants holding the same belief.

There's nothing underpinning the actual $ value of BTC besides exchanges. Unlike stocks, which at least grant you ownership stake in an actual tangible corporation, or precious metals, which have properties that aren't reproducible, BTC itself has no underlying value as an investment if, in the future, no one desires to actually hold onto it.

So it's difficult for me to reach a conclusion other than BTC's ""value"" being nearly all based on the hope that someone else in the future will want to purchase it from you for more than it's worth now, for...reasons??

I would love to have my mind changed, so I would love some thoughtful responses.",0.0
v18tbx,"It seems to me that the most common benchmark used in predicting Bitcoin's future price is having it equal to Gold's market cap, which currently sits at around [$12 trillion](https://8marketcap.com/). Bitcoin would equal this market cap at a price of $571,428 (assuming full dilution and that no coins are lost, which obviously isn't the case but not important for now). 

Gold isn't solely a monetary asset though. It has value as an industrial metal, used in semiconductors, dentistry, etc, and as a decorative asset (jewelry, antiques, etc). 

Are there any reputable studies or estimates out there that break down the market cap of gold as influenced by each of these three categories? My sense is that gold as a monetary asset would constitute the majority of its market cap value, if not the plurality of it, and would love to see some actual estimates. Hard to find anything reputable online...",0.0
vlbu7e,"I love bitcoin. I do believe that it'll become the global currency standard in the futute, and that any other coin is doomed to fail in the long run.

However, I can't help but be concerned about one thing: the privacy of the transactions.

Anyone can see how much money you have and who you send to. Although wallets are pseudonymous, blockchain analysis' companies are getting better and better to determine the real identity of their owners. If this keeps up, those companies will have data about everyone's patrimony and spending habits. I don't think that this is healthy for a monetary system.

So here's my question: is the bitcoin community actually concerned to improve privacy on the blockchain? Is there any improvement proposal in development in that regard that can be implemented in a future update?",-1.0
ushocr,"It's a common post, with good reason. Now-a-days there are countless reasons to do this but pulling all my BTC off the exchanges and into my Bitbox02 is a feeling I can't really describe. It's like owning something for real that no one could take away, ever, for the first time 

For the record, I used the BTC only version of Bitbox because honestly, I've heavily gravitated to only buying BTC and this wallet lessens the security risks by only using BTC. It's easy, safe and important. 

I will let my alts ride, all with under $200 each in them but I'm climbing towards 0.1 BTC and see myself only buying BTC from here out. 

Circle of crypto life I guess, you live and learn!",0.0
