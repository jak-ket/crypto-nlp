wtdemh,"I've gotten into a couple discussions recently with people concerned about an Order 6102 situation where a government tries to confiscate Bitcoin. I wanted to make a post and get more thoughts from people about this. I have my own thoughts that I will post below and if you think my view is wrong I would like to know why.

For those that don't know, [Order 6102](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) was an executive order in the US made in 1933 that outlawed possession of gold and empowered govt officials to confiscate it. They took people's gold and compensated them at a rate of $20/oz. Then they set the price at $35/oz, effectively stealing that value by devaluing their own currency against gold. It was kind of like a one shot 75% inflation boost to their coffers. It was wrong on so many levels and considered by many to be the govt defaulting on their debt obligations. 

At the time gold was still the reserve that backed up US currency and they were in the middle of the great depression. It was a very different time, and gold is very different from Bitcoin. Economies were much more localized and information was vastly more scarce than it is today. Gold could not be easily transported or hidden from authorities. 

At its current market cap and adoption level, Bitcoin is not considered a threat to dollar hegemony, so they have no reason to confiscate it. What about when Bitcoin has grown much larger, to say a $10T MC? If they did then, it would probably still drive up the value even further as it would signal to everyone that they view it as a legitimate threat. We live in a global economy now and massive amounts of information are available at our fingertips. The news would spread instantly and the entire world would take notice and begin thinking about how they can take advantage of the situation.

Then we have to consider what the govt intends to do with the confiscated coin. Are they trying to take it out of circulation? Well then all the remaining Bitcoin just got more scarce and valuable. Are they going to use it as a reserve to back up their own currency? Wow, what an amazing outcome that would be. They would give up all their power in monetary policy that the central bank currently holds to do so. Isn't that what we want?

On top of all that we have to consider the logistics of the confiscation effort. It would be extremely difficult to get people to comply with the order to surrender their Bitcoin, especially if they were trying to compensate at a rate lower than market value. If they tried to straight up steal it the resistance would be violent. That's not even taking into account how long an order like this would be caught up in a legal battle. 

My main point on this is that if it ever came down to a large govt like the US trying to confiscate Bitcoin it will mean that Bitcoin has won the battle. It is the best form that money has ever taken, and it can't be stopped. It is so much bigger than any one government can handle, even at its current size. If they tried to confiscate it I would be celebrating because it will open so many eyes to the value of Bitcoin across the world.",

u47nwf,"Hi all,

(I am in the UK)

This may well be a di*k question but if someone could explain it to me, please:

Suppose you invest your fiat into crypto, such as BTC. Then you make gains. Then you withdraw your funds into your fiat account. 

In the above scenario you need to pay tax on the gains, that I know. 

Now, suppose you do the same but you do not withdraw your funds into your fiat based account... And you find ways to pay for whatever it is you want to purchase online or in store, using crypto, do you still need to pay tax on the above mentioned gains?

I hope this makes sense.

If someone could educate me on this or refer me to a resource on the matter, I would really appreciate it!

Thanks in advance!",

w261jc,"Hello.

I'm trying to help a mate recover an old wallet by writing some code for them.

They know they stored the private key on a disk, but not in which file.

So I coded a disk scanner that looks for Wallet Import Format key, does the checksum check, and displays those that are valid.

The issue is:¬†the wallet is from 2010, and WIF format did not (as far as I can say) exist at the time, so this is fruitless.

They told me they used bitcoin-qt (which makes sense for the time, no bitcoin-core yet).

But they don't remember how they exported the key (so I¬†can't know the format).

My question to the community (if your answer helps, there are even coins in it for you, we don't think it's a big wallet but still) is:

* What kind of key did bitcoin-qt export at the time (what format, so I can write a regex for it) ?
* Were there different methods to do so?

I found a very old link that talked about clicking on ""help"", then entering a debug console, and typing ""dumpprivkey"". Is that the only way they could have done it? Was there an easier method? Which key format would that have produced?

Thank you all for your ancient wisdom!

tt0smg,"I understand the volatility issue vs. bank account (where it slowly only goes down with inflation + printing of money + monthly fees) but the limited bitcoin should only increase as it's more widely adopted as it's slowly but surely happening.

I requested the 401k closure on Monday.  I waited 4 days to get the check, receiving it yesterday.  Today, I went to deposit it.  I checked the bank hours, left my house, drove to the bank in the rain, went in and asked the nice lady at the counter to deposit a check.  

After verifying ID, confirming everything, and handing over the check, they told me that since it is over $5k, they will be holding the check, and the full amount will not be available until the 13th, in 10 days.  I asked them if there's any way they can speed this up by calling the 401k company to verify it... they said they could, but the bank policy is still to hold it for that amount of time.

xbkzxa,"Hi all. 

Long story short, I think the US may be a sinking ship and I'd like to learn how to put money into BTC in prep for a move overseas. I would be liquidating real estate assets and then moving the money into crypto. 

I'm not looking for anything dodgy or gray area, all taxes will be paid, but its possible I may want to rapidly convert all my liquid assets into BTC, then leave the country should the politics here degrade much further. I realize that for me to have this as an option, I'll need to learn how its actually done and hear input from the people who know. 

So, please consider this scenario: You're a political dissident in an oppressive state. You just sold your home, liquidated your retirement accounts, sold your stocks and bonds. You have 3 big 6 figure checks checks from a brokerage, a title company and a bank. You have about 30K in cash assets from a local Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace/Estate sale of your physical belongings. Your objective is to put $700K in checks and $30K cash into BTC. 

How is this done, safely without anything gray area or with heightened risk?

w0ay96,"One of the arguments against bitcoin is that it is a ponzi scheme or a negative sum game that is mathematically certain to collapse once it runs out of new users because it is a non-productive asset.

I think this is a misunderstanding of the underlying economics.

While counterintuitive, in theory Bitcoin price can go up forever and provide a net economic benefit to all bitcoin holders(positive sum game) because of it's fixed supply.

Ponzi schemes have to die because once no new users join the network there is zero economic benefit for existing holders, thus there is no reason to remain invested in it and the ponzi has to collapse.

Interestingly this is not the case with Bitcoin as hodling could be able to provide an economic benefit even when the users of the network reach saturation stage.

That is why Bitcoin can in theory sustain itself forever.

Here is why:

With its fixed supply and zero yield the best Bitcoin can do is to preserve your wealth but not add to it. It does not have earnings or pay dividends.

Since human productivity goes up over time as we learn to be more efficient thanks to technology, goods get cheaper over time.

If we merely preserve our wealth we can afford to buy more goods over time. We get richer in practice if we just manage to preserve our wealth.

For example if global productivity grows several percent each year we could withdraw the rate goods get cheaper each year from our BTC holdings while our purchasing power remains the same. We would never run out of money(purchasing power) and could in theory live forever from our investment if it's large enough.

That is more less the same as receiving a yield from an investment.

Gold is an example of  a non-productive, non-yielding asset that has returned  7.5% annually since  1971 despite having an  annual inflation rate(supply increase) of 1.5%. Without inflation it could have returned 9% annually. Not too bad for a dead rock. Future Bitcoin inflation will be much lower than gold.

Long-term T-Bills had roughly the same return as Gold over the same time period and not all types of bonds or savings accounts have been able to outperform gold. In fact many currency based yielding financial products have not been able to increase  purchasing power over the long-term.

Just because something has  a yield doesn't automatically mean that you will make money.

The Bitcoin network does have a cost which is passed on to it's users either via inflation or transaction fees but due to decreasing inflation the future network cost is expected to be much smaller than the annual increase in human productivity.

That is why the average bitcoin hodler could increase their purchasing power over time even when the user growth reached saturation stage.

In theory the price could go up forever at the rate the currency against it is traded expands it's money supply and the purchasing power of the holder would go up at the rate of human productivity growth.

The fact that holders are rewarded even when the number of users in the network saturates creates an incentive to hold and even a buyer beyond saturation does not necessarily become the bigger fool as they could still extract an economic benefit from acquiring and holding the asset.

That is why bitcoin could keep running forever while a ponzi must collapse because the economic benefits for  a new buyer of a ponzi at saturation stage are negative.

A word of caution:

This is not investment advice but  an analysis based on the properties of a fixed supply asset like bitcoin. Just because the price could go up over time doesn't mean it will. In the end the price will be determined by demand and future demand is hard to estimate. If you acquire bitcoin at a price level where demand is higher than future demand you could still lose a lot of money. Even gold had a maximum drawdown of -60% in the past 50 years. There are also regulatory and technological risks that could affect future demand.",

Most people still do not get the potential of Bitcoin. Why is that. People regard physical reality as the actual reality and money is based on a consensus. We have something that is desired by others.

But if you are in Congo with the same thousand dollars, nothing might happen because those dollars are not revered by the local community.

I need some help.
I want to gift a symbolic amount of bitcoin to my niece for her first birthday. Something that should last at least 10 years with no maintenance. The final solution should also be something intuitive to access for anyone with some knowledge of bitcoin, as I might not be around in 10 or 20 years.
I want it to be a nice present as well, so I bought a cryptochips.io bitcoin coin with a blank square on the backside. 
My initial idea was to generate a bip-39 seed phrase, encode it in a qr code and have it laser-printed on the back of the coin.
As I don't have a laser printer for metal, I thought that I could add a passphrase to the mnemonic before generating the receiving address and send my bitcoin. This  would prevent the laser workshop to possibly steal my bitcoin.
The passphrase could be something simple to remember as name/date of birth of my niece

However I found that
1. Seedsigner does not generate a standardized qr code for the seed phrase. The qr code it generates it's something custom for the seedsigner, it's not part of any bip protocol
2. No bitcoin wallet allows to scan a qr code for the 12 or 24 bip-39 words, and then add a passphrase.
3. No mobile wallet allow to experiment with testnet

w1di0k,"Often a bitcoiner will say ""1 btc = 1 btc"" and then someone, thinking they are clever, will respond with ""well 1 usd = 1 usd"" - so I'd like to explain the flaw in this response, and I'll use a simple example to do so.

Let's take some constant, like ""1 meter."" The ""meter"" is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

Since the speed of light does not change, the length light travels in that time in a vacuum does not change. Therefore, the meter is an unchanging and permanently fixed constant backed by physics and mathematics, i.e. ""1 meter = 1 meter.""

If the speed of light were somehow centrally planned and constantly changing (read: inflating), then 1 meter would not be a reliable and we could not measure length effectively. Buildings could not be built and no one would be able to communicate distance. You can substitute the meter with any other mathematical constant to illustrate the same concept.

Similarly, a ""bitcoin"" can be defined as a single token out of 21 million. Since the cap cannot change, a bitcoin is also a permanently fixed constant backed by physics and cryptography, i.e. ""1 btc = 1 btc.""

The same cannot be said of the dollar, as it is one unit out of a forever increasing total, centrally planned supply. This is similar to the speed of light always changing, messing with the ""meter"" definition and our ability to measure. The changing inconsistency of the dollar leads to distortion in ""measurements"" (read: prices) that is destructive to society - which bitcoin remedies.

It is the first constant in the field of economics. The importance of this can hardly be overstated.

tl;dr: The ""1 btc = 1 btc"" does NOT mean how much a btc is valued in fiat, nor does it indicate how much a bitcoin can buy, nor is it a tongue-in-cheek tautology. It's a phrase indicating the fixed, mathematical, physically-tethered nature of bitcoin.",

The thing is, J. Pow keeps raising rates. The higher he raises rates, the more expensive it is to borrow money. So I'm doing this now to lock in a lower interest rate. This time around, I plan to DCA it into BTC much slower. If the macro situation is really as bad as they say, then BTC may still go lower.

The crazy thing is that I managed to get a lower interest rate this time! Back in February, the loan I got was 6% APR, but with the new $20k loan I'm only paying $4.5%! I have no idea why that is. The only thing that changed is that my credit score increased about 50 points, but I don't think that really explains it.

With the $15k loan I started DCAing it into BTC daily around February 23rd, 2022, a day or two before Russia invaded Ukraine. Within 8 weeks I had invest the full $15k at a cost basis of \~$38k. In retrospect, I should have spread it out longer, like 16 weeks instead of just 8. I won't make that mistake this time. I plan to DCA this current loan in BTC at $125 per day over the next 5 months or so... unless we drop to $13k, then I'll lump sum whatever is left.

I basically view this as a reverse DCA. Together, the combined loans require about $550 a month to service. I can afford this. Not a big deal.  I usually invest about $500-700 a month anyway, so it's still affordable for me. In fact, I'll most likely pay both of them off early just so that I save on the interest, not that it's much anyway.

My plan is simple: acquire and hold Bitcoin. I have no intention of selling, but if I did, I'd wait until at least 2032  because by then there will have been 3 halvings and 99% of Bitcoin will have been mined. So I think the price by then will be well over $100k if not $250k. But I'd rather just never sell at all.

Anyway, I will update in 6 months.",

vfrrag,Having seen all the news regarding Bitcoin at the moment I'm thinking of investing a small amount. I know this is a bit of a basic and dumb question but could someone direct me towards anything that would help in making a purchase. Also I'm looking to invest quite a small amount would it even be worth it? Thanks in advance.,
zbboj5,"There is  a lot of talk about how game will be over for BTC once CBDCs are released.

I think people do completely overestimate governments and CBDCs.

First of all CBDCs will just be digital fiat which already exists and apps and with digital banking and credit cards.

Second CBDCs won't be very popular. Imagine the government launching their own social media platform to make sure that content shared complies with what governments think matters.

How any people would like govbook?

The government can't even launch their own healthcare website, thinking they will create  a competitive digital app is naive.

People don't use Bitcoin because they want to transfer money over the internet and it does  a better job than credit cards or paypal. They use it because they don't have credit cards, they want to control their own money, they want irreversible instant settlements, cross-border transactions and they want to protect themselves against monetary inflation.

CBDCs will be highly limited by KYC, likely restricted in many ways, have no privacy will be used to manipulated behavior, will be censored, have geographic limitations, will be highly inflationary and can be confiscated at any time and will not be an open protocol. CBDCs will be local and can't be universal internet money.

The central banks are deluded if they think they will be able to compete with a popular open source software.

CBDC will likely be used to send people money to keep the failing monetary system running and people will have an account to receive some cash. It won't be the currency of the internet,  a store  of value or  a place where people will put their wealth or something that companies build their business on. Just another stale government app.",

Time travel stuff. 

Satoshi lives among us but he doesn‚Äôt know yet about that he is a bitcoin inventor.

In future current noname Satoshi will meet another man that explain what to do and send him back to 2008 to create bitcoin node, whitepaper, mine some bitcoins and create several conversations in forum, then returns back to his time.

The most closest explanation how all this can become what it is now.",
vbeesk,"At times like these stop thinking about the price. Think about what we are building Bitcoin for and think about the work it will take to get us there. There has never been a project like this before in the history of the world! An asset, controlled by no one and accessible to everyone as a bearer instrument with an algorithmic hard supply limit. It‚Äôs value is not derived from the talents of a board or the charisma of a CEO. There is no one to sue for ‚Äúneglecting shareholder value‚Äù. This algorithm has the potential to become the base layer for money which is arguably humanities most important tool for communication. In the future, it could underlay the internet, property rights and in some places even augment/replace many functions of governments. Bitcoin is in its infancy and you are living in a time when you can exchange manipulated fiat money representing your time and energy directly into ownership of a portion of this network. Can it still fail to achieve its goals? Only if we stop working towards them. Go talk to a coffee shop owner about lightning. Buy a hardware wallet.

Everyone in the world told me not to do this. Even this subreddit told me not to do it.

But I did it anyway. Just now.

I just don't give a flying fuck. I would rather hold onto that value on the blockchain instead. There's a lot more utility to having it in the form of btc.

I don't care about the fees, I will make the fees back and more.

I don't care if I have to hold for a million years, what tf else am I going to hold?

And that's my point.

What point is there to holding anything else other than bitcoin? ever?

There's nothing more valuable in my opinion, I just can't unsee it.

set15e,"IMO, a big problem I see for the future use of bitcoin as a currency is the volatility. It would suck to have even 10% less purchasing power within 24 hours.

v57q48,"I am not a Bitcoin dev nor have I any coding experience but I'd like to put this out there just in case this may be a viable solution to Bitcoin's on chain privacy. If there are any Bitcoin devs reading this, I'd love some input.

The basic idea is you have a pool of transactions you can pull UTXOs from to use in future transactions provided you show proof that a deposit to the pool was made first. There is no one that controls this pool, it's just a collection of transactions that have the same spending requirements. The oldest UTXOs are used before the newest ones. If the UTXO being used exceeds the amount for the eligible party to spend, the change is sent back to the pool. If the UTXO is too small, the UTXO of the transaction next in line is included in the input.

What it looks like in action: Alice sends a transaction to the pool. Alice sends Bob a key that only Bob can use that acts as a proof of Alice's transaction to the pool. Bob can then use that proof in order to use the UTXOs in the oldest transaction(s) to make his own transaction to the pool. Bob then sends a key to Carol to which she can do the same to spend to Nancy. This can be done ad infinitum until you leave the pool.

I can see this also working with second layer solutions. For example for Lightning Network, instead of Alice sending the proof of deposit to Bob they create a multisig sharing the proof. For Statechains the proof is turned into a statecoin. The proof basically takes the place of a regular transaction not tying it to any one UTXO.

vty7bn,"So my dad found this bitcoin trading company and invested AUD500. Over the course of a week this AUD500 has supposedly grown to around USD25,000. I have been sceptical since. And now the company is saying to pay out my dad must first give them the commision of 20% of the pay out amount. They're saying my dad must first give the money before they can gain access to the company wallet or something like that.

Note that the company website cannot be found via a simple Google search. I have the company website but only because my dad sent me the link to it. I'm assuming the company sent it to him. The website had an address which when searched in Google Maps shows up as a run-down building in Amsterdam listed as an advertising company. When Googling the advertising company, I found that it has a domain registered but no content in the website.

If this type of post isn't allowed here please let me know, otherwise I could use some help before my dad may potentially lose money.

Edit: Now that I am 100% sure it is a scam, the company is called Megaways Trading",
wb7h21,"Expending energy to *produce* additional tokens is a sound principle. But what about the need to expend energy merely to *maintain* the money?

Once all Bitcoins are mined, all energy spent from that point is to maintain the network.

Is a drawback? If a form of money existed that did not require this energy expenditure just to maintain the money, would that be superior? 


Yes, I know with Bitcoin the energy is being spent to perform transactions. So with Bitcoin it is literally impossible to do away with this energy expenditure. But, if we could ask God for a form of money that:

1) Takes energy to produce 

2) Has a supply that cannot be tampered with

3) Does not require energy to maintain, but can still be traded around

Would this be objectively superior to Bitcoin?",
